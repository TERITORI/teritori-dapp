## Introduction

> **Warning**: Teritori is still under active development and should be used carefuly, with a Beta tester approach.

**[Teritori dApp](https://www.teritori.com/)** is a all-in-one application providing various coordination & communication features for humans. 
In the future (v3) it will also be a privacy first messaging application built on top of [the Berty Protocol](https://berty.tech/docs/protocol/).

- *Genesis Era - Alpha (Web only)* :
    - Multichain NFT Marketplace v0.1 (Teritori Network first)

On this Genesis Era, core team will gather various tools, dapps, and open source code from most serious Cosmos contributors, in a Teritori User Experience, to onboard new users into the state of the art. Team is at the same time paralelizing its development and re-building this 'state of the art' code using Gnolang. This allow teritori-core team #1 to both start shipping tools quickly to community and prepare the future proof approach with a deep state of the art expertise.
