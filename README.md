<h3 align="center"> Teritori is a decentralized application, with a dedicated Cosmos SDK Blockchain, providing tools for decentralized organizations & Web3 adventurers.</h3> 

In 2024, team target is to be one of the first dApp using [Gnolang](https://www.gnoland.space/docs/what-is-gno) smartcontracts, allowing to build smartcontracts in Go, with a robust and radically transparent approach.

> **Warning**: Teritori is still under active alpha development and not audited yet. The dApp should be used very carefuly.

## Introduction

> **Warning**: Teritori is still under active development and should be used carefuly, with a Beta tester approach.

**[Teritori dApp](https://app.teritori.com/)** is a all-in-one application providing various coordination & communication features for humans. 
In the future (v3) it will also be a privacy first messaging application built on top of [the Berty Protocol](https://berty.tech/docs/protocol/).

- *Genesis Era - Alpha (Web only)* :
    - Multichain NFT Marketplace v0.1 (Teritori Network first)
    - Staking $TORI Tokens 
    - Teritori Chain Governance (& Bounty Program)

On this Genesis Era, core team will gather various tools, dapps, and open source code from most serious Cosmos contributors, in a Teritori User Experience, to onboard new users into the state of the art. Team is at the same time paralelizing its development and re-building this 'state of the art' code using Gnolang. This allow teritori-core team #1 to both start shipping tools quickly to community and prepare the future proof approach with a deep state of the art expertise.

**Teritori** is designed to be managed by community, with a step by step strategy allowing to empower the user:

- Vote on upcoming launches of the Launchpad (The R!OT)
- Vote on upcoming Premium features
- Vote on Bounties Allocations
- Vote on every new proposals provided by community 
- Users are not simply passive users, but are incentivized to participate. Let's make governance great again.

Teritori is currently launched by a distributed core team, bootstrapping the network & dApp development, with the mission to make it governed by users, developped by more and more builders from all ecosystems. 
A dedicated Grants program, a Bounties program, are currently prepared by the core team to allow external contributors to join us.
