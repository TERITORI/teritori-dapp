- Check your [assigned PRs that require changes](https://github.com/TERITORI/teritori-dapp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Achanges_requested+draft%3Afalse+assignee%3A%40me+) and address the reviews
- Make sure you have self-reviewed your exitsing PRs and the CI passes on them
- Continue on your assigned tasks
- If you have nothing to do at this point, ask for a new task

## Creating a PR
