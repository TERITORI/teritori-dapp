## Contributor guidelines

### Core contributor loop

- Check the [list of PRs that need review](https://github.com/TERITORI/teritori-dapp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Arequired+draft%3Afalse+) and review relevant PRs, see [Reviewing a PR](#reviewing-a-pr)
- Check your [assigned PRs that require changes](https://github.com/TERITORI/teritori-dapp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Achanges_requested+draft%3Afalse+assignee%3A%40me+) and address the reviews
- Make sure you have self-reviewed your existing PRs and the CI passes on them, see [Reviewing a PR](#reviewing-a-pr)
- Continue on your assigned tasks
- If you have nothing to do at this point, ask for a new task

For all tasks, create a PR as soon as possible to make other mates aware of your work and to prevent you from going in a bad direction

### Creating a PR

- Make sure the PR's title follows [the conventional commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as it will be used as the squashed commit title on main
- Make sure your are assigned to the PR, this helps you to know [which PRs require your attention](https://github.com/TERITORI/teritori-dapp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+assignee%3A%40me)
- Try to keep the PR [atomic](https://fagnerbrack.com/one-pull-request-one-concern-e84a27dfe9f1), it will be merged faster and benefit all your mates
- Self-review the changes and pass CI before asking for other peoples reviews, see [Reviewing a PR](#reviewing-a-pr)

### Reviewing a PR

- Read and understand all changes
  
  You can use the GitHub diff and mark each file as viewed, this will help in subsequent reviews as unchanged files will keep the "Viewed" status

- Test
  
  Check that the feature works or the bug is fixed

  If there is changes in code used at other places, test for regressions in affected features

If the PR is not atomic enough and makes reviewing hard, you can ask the author to split it

You can deny the review if the PR does not pass CI
